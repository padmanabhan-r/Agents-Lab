## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Jupyter or VS Code with Jupyter extension
- API keys for various LLM providers (as needed)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/padmanabhan-r/Agents-Lab.git
cd Agents-Lab

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key
# Add other API keys as needed
```

## üìì Usage

1. Navigate to any notebook directory (e.g., `crewAI/`, `smolagents/`)
2. Open a notebook with Jupyter or VS Code
3. Read the documentation within each notebook
4. Execute cells to see agents in action
5. Modify parameters and prompts to experiment with different behaviors

### Example Workflows

- **Research Assistant**: Automatically gather, analyze, and summarize information on a topic
- **Customer Support**: Create multi-agent systems that handle user queries and escalate when needed
- **Data Analysis**: Use agents to clean, analyze, and visualize data with minimal human intervention
